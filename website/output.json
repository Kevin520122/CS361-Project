  "origin": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), also known as the coronavirus, or COVID, is a contagious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first known case was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. The disease has since spread worldwide, leading to an ongoing pandemic.Symptoms of COVID-19 are variable, but often include fever, cough, headache, fatigue, breathing difficulties, and loss of smell and taste. Symptoms may begin one to fourteen days after exposure to the virus. At least a third of people who are infected do not develop noticeable symptoms. Of those people who develop noticeable symptoms enough to be classed as patients, most (81%) develop mild to moderate symptoms (up to mild pneumonia), while 14% develop severe symptoms (dyspnea, hypoxia, or more than 50% lung involvement on imaging), and 5% suffer critical symptoms (respiratory failure, shock, or multiorgan dysfunction). Older people are at a higher risk of developing severe symptoms. Some people continue to experience a range of effects (long COVID) for months after recovery, and damage to organs has been observed. Multi-year studies are underway to further investigate the long-term effects of the disease.Transmission of COVID-19 occurs when people are exposed to virus-containing respiratory droplets and airborne particles exhaled by an infected person. Those particles may be inhaled or may reach the mouth, nose, or eyes of a person through touching or direct deposition (i.e. being coughed on). The risk of infection is highest when people are in close proximity for a long time, but particles can be inhaled over longer distances, particularly indoors in poorly ventilated and crowded spaces. In those conditions small particles can remain suspended in the air for minutes to hours. Touching a contaminated surface or object may lead to infection although this does not contribute substantially to transmission. People who are infected can transmit the virus to another person up to two days before they themselves show symptoms, as can people who do not experience symptoms. People remain infectious for up to ten days after the onset of symptoms in moderate cases and up to twenty days in severe cases.Several testing methods have been developed to diagnose the disease. The standard diagnostic method is by detection of the virus' nucleic acid by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), transcription-mediated amplification (TMA), or by reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) from a nasopharyngeal swab.\\nPreventive measures include physical or social distancing, quarantining, ventilation of indoor spaces, covering coughs and sneezes, hand washing, and keeping unwashed hands away from the face. The use of face masks or coverings has been recommended in public settings to minimize the risk of transmissions. Several vaccines have been developed and many countries have initiated mass vaccination campaigns.\\nAlthough work is underway to develop drugs that inhibit the virus, the primary treatment is symptomatic. Management involves the treatment of symptoms, supportive care, isolation, and experimental measures.\n",

  "translation": "2019年冠状病毒病（COVID-19），也称为冠状病毒或COVID，是由严重急性呼吸系统综合症冠状病毒2（SARS-CoV-2）引起的传染病。第一个已知病例于2019年12月在中国武汉发现。该疾病自那时以来已在世界范围内传播，导致持续的大流行。COVID-19的症状多种多样，但通常包括发烧，咳嗽，头痛，疲劳，呼吸困难，并失去气味和味道。暴露于病毒后，症状可能会开始十四至十四天。至少有三分之一的被感染者没有出现明显的症状。在那些出现明显症状足以被归类为患者的人群中，大多数（81％）出现轻度至中度症状（直至轻度肺炎），而14％出现严重症状（呼吸困难，缺氧或肺部受累超过50％）成像），而5％则患有严重症状（呼吸衰竭，休克或多器官功能障碍）。老年人患严重症状的风险较高。在恢复后的几个月中，有些人继续经历一系列影响（长COVID），并且已经观察到器官受损。正在进行多年研究以进一步研究该疾病的长期影响。当人们暴露于含有病毒的呼吸道飞沫和被感染者呼出的空气中的颗粒物时，COVID-19的传播就会发生。这些颗粒可能被吸入或通过触摸或直接沉积（即被咳嗽）到达人的嘴，鼻子或眼睛。当人们长时间靠近时，感染的风险最高，但是颗粒物可以被吸入更远的距离，尤其是在通风不良和拥挤空间中的室内。在那些条件下，小颗粒可以在空气中悬浮数分钟至数小时。触摸受污染的表面或物体可能会导致感染，尽管这基本上不会导致传播。被感染的人可以将病毒传播给其他人，直到他们自己出现症状之前的两天，而没有经历过症状的人也可以。在中度症状发作后，人们会持续感染长达10天，而在重度病例中，人们会持续感染20天。已经开发出多种测试方法来诊断这种疾病。标准的诊断方法是通过实时逆转录聚合酶链反应（rRT-PCR），转录介导的扩增（TMA）或逆转录环介导的等温扩增（RT-LAMP）检测病毒核酸\\ n预防措施包括身体上或社交上的距离，隔离，室内空间通风，咳嗽和打喷嚏，洗手以及保持未洗手远离面部。建议在公共场所使用口罩或面罩，以将传播的风险降到最低。已经开发了几种疫苗，许多国家也发起了大规模疫苗接种运动。\\ n尽管正在进行开发抑制病毒的药物的工作，但主要的治疗方法是对症治疗。管理涉及症状的治疗，支持治疗，隔离和实验措施。"
